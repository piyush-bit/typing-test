    "et": "4.24 Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in action.",
    "ec": "4.24 ब्रह्म Brahman? अर्पणम् the oblation? ब्रह्म Brahman? हविः the clarified butter? ब्रह्माग्नौ in the fire of Brahman? ब्रह्मणा by Brahman? हुतम् is offered? ब्रह्म Brahman? एव only? तेन by him? गन्तव्यम् shall be reached? ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना by the man who is absorbed in action which is Brahman.Commentary This is JnanaYajna or wisdomsacrifice wherein the idea of Brahman is substituted for the ideas of the instrument and other accessories of action? the idea of action itself and of its results. By entertaining such an idea the whole action melts away? as stated in the previous verse (No.23).When one attains to the knowledge of the Self or Selfrealisation his whole life becomes a wisdomsacrifice in which the oblation? the melted butter or the offering? the performer of the sacrifice? the action and the goal are all Brahman. He who meditates thus wholly upon Brahman shall verily attain to Brahman.The sage who has the knowledge of the Self knows that the oblation? the fire? the instrument by which the melted butter is poured into the fire and himself have no existence apart from that of Brahman. He who has realised through direct cognitio (Anubhava) that all is Brahman? does no action even if he performs actions. (Cf.III.15)"
