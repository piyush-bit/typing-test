Therefore wisdomsacrifice is superior to the sacrifice performed with material objects. Just as rivers join the ocean? so do all actions join knowledge? i.e.? they culminate in knowledge. All actions purify the heart and lead to the dawn of knowledge of the Self.All actions that are performed as offerings unto the Lord with their fruits are contained in the knowledge of Brahman. (Cf.IX.15X.25XVIII.70)"
