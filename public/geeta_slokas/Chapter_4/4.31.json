    "ec": "4.31 यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजः eaters of the nectar -- the remnants of the sacrifice? यान्ति go? ब्रह्म Brahman? सनातनम् eternal? न not? अयम् this? लोकः world? अस्ति is? अयज्ञस्य of the nonsacrificer? कुतः how? अन्यः other? कुरुसत्तम O best of the Kurus.Commentary They go to the eternal Brahman in course of time after attaining the knowledge of the Self through purification of the mind by performing the above sacrifices. He who does not perform any of these is not fit even for this miserable world. How then can he hope to get a better world than this (Cf.III.13)"
