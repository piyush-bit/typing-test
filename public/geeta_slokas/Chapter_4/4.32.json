    "ec": "4.32 एवम् thus? बहुविधाः manifold? यज्ञाः sacrifices? वितताः are spread? ब्रह्मणः of Brahman (or of the Veda)? मुखे in the face? कर्मजान् born of action? विद्धि know (thou)? तान् them? सर्वान् all? एवम् thus? ज्ञात्वा having known? विमोक्ष्यसे thou shalt be liberated.Commentary The word Brahmanah has also been interpreted to mean In the Vedas.Various kinds of sacrifices are spread out at the mouth of Brahman? i.e.? they are known from the Vedas. Know that they are born of action? because the Self is beyond action. If you realise that these actions do not concern me? they are not my actin? and I am actionless? you will surely be liberated from the bondage of Samsara by this right knowledge. (Cf.IX.27XIII.15)"
