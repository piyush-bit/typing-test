    "ec": "4.13 चातुर्वर्ण्यम् the fourfold caste? मया be Me? सृष्टम् has been created? गुणकर्मविभागशः according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma? तस्य thereof? कर्तारम् the author? अपि also? माम् Me? विद्धि know? अकर्तारम् nondoer? अव्ययम् immutable.Commentary The four castes (Brahmana? Kshatriya? Vaishya and Sudra) are classified according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma. In a Brahmana? Sattva predominates. He possesses selfrestraint? purity? serenity? straightforwardness? devotion? etc. In a Kshatriya? Rajs predominates. He possesses prowess? splendour? firmness? dexterity? generosity and the nature of a ruler. In a Vaishya? Rajas predominates and Tamas is subordinate to Rajas. He does the duty of ploughing? protection of cattle and trade. In a Sudra Tamas predominates and Rajas is subordinate to Tamas. He does service to the other three castes. Human temperaments and tendencies vary according to the Gunas.Though the Lord is the author of the caste system? yet He is not the author as He is the nondoer. He is not subject to Samsara. Really Maya does everything. Maya is the real author. Society can exist in a flourishing state if the four castes do their duties properly. Otherwise there will be chaos? rupture and fighting. (Cf.XVIII.41)."
