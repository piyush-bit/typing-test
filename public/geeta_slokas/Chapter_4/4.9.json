He is ever beyond all actions. He who knows this is never born again. He attains knowledge of the Self and becomes liberated while living.The birth of the Lord is an illusion. It is Aprakrita (beyond the pale of Nature). It is divine. It is peculiar to the Lord. Though He appears in human form? His body is Chinmaya (full of consciousness? not inert matter as are human bodies composed of the five elements)."
