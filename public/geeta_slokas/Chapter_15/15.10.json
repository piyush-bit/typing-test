    "ec": "15.10 उत्क्रामन्तम् departing? स्थितम् staying? वा or? अपि also? भुञ्जानम् enjoying? वा or? गुणान्वितम् united with the Gunas? विमूढाः the deluded? न not? अनुपश्यन्ति do see (Him)? पश्यन्ति behold (Him)? ज्ञानचक्षुषः those who possess the eye of knowledge.Commentary Though the Self is nearest and comes most easily within their field of vision or consciousness? the ignorant and the deluded are not able to behold Him? because they are swayed by the alities of Nature their minds constantly run towards the sensual objects and are saturated with passion they identify the Self with the body their vision is engrossed in external forms. But those who are endowed with the inner eye of intuition do behold Him.Yama said to Nachiketas The selfexistent Brahma created the senses with outgoing tendencies therefore man beholds the external universe and not the internal Self. He aded But some wise men with their senses turned away from the objects? desirous of immortality? turn their gaze inwards and behold the Self within (seated in their heart). (Katha Upanishad IV.1)Those who possess the inner eye of knowledge behold that the Self is entirely distinct from the body. They realise the Selfs separate existence from the body and know that the body moves and acts on account of Its presence therein? just as the iron moves and acts in the presence of the magnet."
