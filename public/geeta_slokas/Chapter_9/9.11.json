    "ec": "9.11 अवजानन्ति disregard? माम् Me? मूढाः fools? मानुषीम् human? तनुम् form? आश्रितम् assumed? परम् higher? भावम् state or nature? अजानन्तः not knowing? मम My? भूतमहेश्वरम् the Great Lord of beings.Commentary Fools only find fault with My pure nature? just as a man with jaundiced eyes finds all objects to be yellow. The man who is suffering from fever finds even milk as bitter as the essence of neem. Those who wish to behold Me by means of the physical eyes cannot know Me. If anyone takes the mirage for the Ganga? can he find any water thereFools who do not have discrimination and right understanding despise Me? dwelling in the human form. I have taken this body to bless My devotees. These fools have no knowledge of My higher Being. They do not know that I am the great Lord? the Supreme SElf? the luminous? omniscient? pure? ever free? immortal? wise? the Self of all. These fools take Me for an ordinary mortal and despise Me always. The wise know both My transcendental nature and the glory of My manifestation.I pervade? permeate and interpenetrate the universe. I am the support of this world? body? mind? lifeforce and the senses and yet there are some miserable fools? who say that I do not exist. There is thus not a place anywhere where I am not? and yet these people are not able to see Me. Look at the misfortune of these people. Pitiable is their lot (Cf.IV.6VII.24)"
