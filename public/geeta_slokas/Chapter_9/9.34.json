    "ec": "9.34 मन्मनाः with mind filled with Me? भव be thou? मद्भक्तः My devotee? मद्याजी sacrificing unto Me? माम्,unto Me? नमस्कुरु bow down? माम् to Me? एव alone? एष्यसि thou shalt come? युक्त्वा having united? एवम् thus? आत्मानम् the self? मत्परायणः taking Me as the Supreme Goal.Commentary Fill thy mind with Me. Fix your head? heart and hands on Me. Get your heart in tune with Me. Become a true worshipper. You will secure eternal bliss. Having known Me? you will cross beyond death.The whole being of man should be surrendered to the Lord without reservation. Then the whole life will undergo a wonderful transformation. You will have the vision of God everywhere. All sorrows and pains will vanish. Your mind will be one with the divine consciousness.Just as the potether becomes one with the universal ether when the limiting adjunct (pot) is broken? just as the Ganga and the Yamuna? leaving their names and forms become one with the ocean? so also the sage gets rid of Avidya and all sorts of limiting adjuncts through the direct realisation of the Self and becomes identical with Para Brahman.Yukta means steadied in thought? having thus fixed the mind on the Lord? knowing that I am the Self of all beings and the highest goal. (Cf.V.17VII.7?14XVIII.65)(This chapter is known by the name Adhyatma Yoga also.)Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the ninth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Kingly Science and the Kingly Secret.,"
