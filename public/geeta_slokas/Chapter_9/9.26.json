    "ec": "9.26 पत्रम् a leaf? पुष्पम् a flower? फलम् a fruit? तोयम् water? यः who? मे to Me? भक्त्या with devotion? प्रयच्छति,offers? तत् that? अहम् I? भक्त्युपहृतम् offered with devotion? अश्नामि eat (accept)? प्रयतात्मनः of the pureminded.Commentary A gift? however small? is accepted by the Lord? when it is offered with profound faith. The Lord is ite satisfied even with a leaf? a flower? a fruit or water? when it is offered with singleminded devotion and pure heart. Was He not satisfied with the little parched rice from the bundle of Sudama and the small berries offered by Sabari You need not build a golden temple for Him. Build a golden temple in your heart. Enthrone Him there. He wants only your devoted heart. But it is difficult to please Indra. You wll have to offer valuable (material) objects to him.A leaf? a flower of a fruit are merely symbols. The true means of attaining the Lord is pure unflinching devotion. All the objects of the state belong to the king. If the servants of the state offer with devotion some objects to the king he is highly satisfied. Even so all the objects of the whole world belong to Him. Yet? He is highly pleased if you offer even a little thing with devotion.Asnami? literally means eat. The indicative meaning or Lakshana Vritti is accept."
