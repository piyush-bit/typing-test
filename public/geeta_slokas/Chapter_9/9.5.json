    "et": "9.5 Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality); behold My divine Yoga, supporting all beings, but not dwelling in them, is My Self, the efficient cause of beings.",
    "ec": "9.5 न not? च and? मत्स्थानि dwelling in Me? भूतानि beings? पश्य behold? मे My? योगम् Yoga? ऐश्वरम् Divine? भूतभृत् supporting the beings? न not? च and? भूतस्थः dwelling in the beings? मम My? आत्मा Self? भूतभावनः bringing forth beings.Commentary Brahman or the Self no connection with any object as It is very subtle and attributes and formless and so It is unattached (Asanga). There cannot be any real connection between matter and Spirit. Saakara (an object with form) can have no connection with Nirakara (the formless). How could this be Devoid of attachment It is never attached. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad? III.9.26) Though unattached? It supports all beings It is the efficient or instrumental cause It brings forth all beings but It does not dwell in them? because It is unconnected with any object. This is a great mystery. Just as the dreamer has no connection with the dream object? just as ether or air has no connection with the vessel? so also Brahman has no connection with the objects or the body. The connection between the Self and the physical body is illusory.The Adhishthana or support (Brahman) for the illusory object (Kalpitam) superimposed on,Brahman has no connection whatsoever with the alities or the defects of the objects that are superimposed on the Absolute. The snake is superimposed on a rope. The rope is the support (Adhishthana) for the illusory snake (Kalpitam). This is an example of superimposition or Adhyasa. (Cf.VII.25X.7.XI.8)"
