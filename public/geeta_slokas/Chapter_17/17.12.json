The performer of this kind of sacrifice has the motive of increasing his own importance? for popularising his own name in the world? for gaining some reward? for showing himself off as a great? pious and learned man? for making an exhibition of his riches for his own glorificaion. He has no aspiration for attaining the knowledge of the Self."
