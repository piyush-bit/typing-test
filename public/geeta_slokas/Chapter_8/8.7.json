You must work with the mind and intellect devoted to Him.Fight Perform your own Dharma? the duty of a Kshatriya. It will purify your heart and you will attain to knowledge and come to Me. The term fight is Upalakshana (suggestive). It means Do your duties according to your caste and order of life. VarnashramaDharmas (the duties pertaining to the various castes and orders of life) and NityaNaimittika Karmas are the Upalakshanas (factors suggested or alluded to).The ChittaVritti which is of the form of the object meditated upon is the Bhavana. (ChittaVrittis is mental modification). The Bhavana is for those who practise Saguna Upasana. Bhavana at the time of separtion of the body is not necessary for a sage or a Jnani who has attained to the knowledge of the Self or Selfrealisation. (Cf.IX.34XII.8?11)"
