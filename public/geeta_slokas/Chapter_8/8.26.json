    "ec": "8.26 शुक्लकृष्णे bright and dark? गती (two) paths? हि verily? एते these? जगतः of the world? शाश्वते eternal? मते are thought? एकया by one? याति (he) goes? अनावृत्तिम् to nonreturn? अन्यया by another? आवर्तते (he) returns? पुनः again.Commentary The bright path is the path to the gods taken by the devotees. The dark path is of the manes taken by those who perform sacrifices or charitable acts with the expectation of rewards. These two paths are not open to the whole world. The bright path is open to the devotees and the dark one to those who are devoted to the rituals. These paths are as eternal as the Samsara.World here means devotees or people devoted to ritual.Pitriloka or Chandraloka is Svarga or heaven."
