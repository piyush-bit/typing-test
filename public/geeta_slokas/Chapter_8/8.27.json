    "ec": "8.27 न not? एते these? सृती two paths? पार्थ O Partha? जानन् knowing? योगी the Yogi? मुह्यति is deluded? कश्चन anyone? तस्मात् therefore? सर्वेषु in all? कालेषु times? योगयुक्तः steadfast in Yoga? भव (be) thou? अर्जुन O Arjuna.Commentary Knowing the nature of the two paths and the conseences they lead to? a Yogi never loses his discrimination. The Yogi who knows that the path of the gods or the path of light leads to Moksha (gradual liberation)? and the path of darkness to Samsara or the world or region of birth and death? is no longer deluded. Knowledge of these two paths serves as a compass or a beaconlight to guide the Yogis steps at every moment. He strives to stick to the path of light."
