    "et": "6.6 The Self is the friend of the self of him by whom the self has been conered by the Self, but to the unconered self, this Self stands in the position of an enemy, like an (external) foe.",
    "ec": "6.6 बन्धुः friend? आत्मा the Self? आत्मनः of the self? तस्य his? येन by whom? आत्मा the self? एव even? आत्मना by the Self? जितः is conered? अनात्मनः of unconered self? तु but? शत्रुत्वे in the place of an enemy? वर्तेत would remain? आत्मा the Self? एव even? शत्रुवत् like an enemy.Commentary Coner the lower mind through the higher mind. The lower mind is your enemy. The higher mind is your friend. If you make friendship with the higher mind you can subdue the lower mind ite easily. The lower mind is filled with Rajas and Tamas (passion and darkness). The higher mind is filled with Sattva or purity.The Self is the friend of one who is selfcontrolled? and who has subjugated the lower mind and the senses. But the Self is an enemy of one who has no selfrestraint? and who has not subdued the lower mind and the senses. Just as an external enemy does harm to him? so also his own (lower) self (mind) does harm to him. The lower mind injures him severely. The highest Self or Atman is the primary Self. Mind also is self. This is the secondary self."
