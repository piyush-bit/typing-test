    "ec": "6.3 आरुरुक्षोः wishing to climb? मुनेः of a Muni or sage? योगम् Yoga? कर्म action? कारणम् the cause? उच्यते is said? योगारूढस्य of one who has attained to Yoga? तस्य of him? एव even? शमः inaction (iescence)? कारणम् the cause? उच्यते is said.Commentary For a man who cannot practise meditation for a long time and who is not able to keep his mind steady in meditation? action is a means to get himself enthroned in Yoga. Action purifies his mind and makes the mind fit for the practice of steady meditation. Action leads to steady concentration and meditation.For the sage who is enthroned in Yoga? Sama or renunciation of actions is said to be the means.The more perfectly he abstains from actions? the more steady his mind is? and the more peaceful,he is? the more easily and thoroughly does his mind get fixed in the Self. For a Brahmana there is no wealth like unto the knowledge of oneness and homogeneity (of the Self in all beings)? truthfulness? good character? steadiness? harmlessness? straightforwardness and renunciation of all actions. (Mahabharata? Santi Parva? 175.38)"
