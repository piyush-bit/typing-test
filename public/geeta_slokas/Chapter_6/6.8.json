    "et": "6.8 The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom (of the Self), who has conered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonied (i.e., is said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi).",
    "ec": "6.8 ज्ञानविज्ञानतृप्तात्मा one who is satisfied with knowledge and wisdom (Selfrealisation)? कूटस्थः unshaken? विजितेन्द्रियः who has conered the senses? युक्तः united or harmonised? इति thus? उच्यते is said? योगी Yogi? समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः one to whom a lump of earth? a stone and gold are the same.Commentary Jnana is ParokshaJnana or theoretical knowledge from the study of the scriptures. Vijnana is Visesha Jnana or Aparoksha Jnana? i.e.? direct knowledge of the Self through Selfrealisation (spiritual experience or Anubhava).Kutastha means changeless like the anvil. Various kinds of iron pieces are hammered and shaped on the anvil? but the anvil remains unchanged. Even so the Yogi remains unshaken or unchanged or unaffected though he comes in contact with the senseobjects. So he is called Kutastha. Kutastha is another name of Brahman? the silent witness of the mind. (Cf.V.18VI.18)"
