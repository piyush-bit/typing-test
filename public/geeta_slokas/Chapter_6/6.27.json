    "ec": "6.27 प्रशान्तमनसम् one of peaceful mind? हि verily? एनम् this? योगिनम् Yogi? सुखम् bliss? उत्तमम् supreme? उपैति comes? शान्तरजसम् one whose passion is ieted? ब्रह्मभूतम् one who has become Brahman? अकल्मषम् one who is free from sin.Commentary In this verse and in the next also the Lord describes the benefits of Yoga.Supreme (eternal? unalloyed and uninterrupted) bliss comes to the Yogi whose mind is perfectly serene? who has calmed his passionate nature? who has destroyed all sorts of attachments? who has attained knowledge of the Self and thus become a Jivanmukta or one who is liberated while living? who feels that all is Brahman only? and who is taintless? i.e.? who is not affected by Dharma or Adharma (good or evil)."
