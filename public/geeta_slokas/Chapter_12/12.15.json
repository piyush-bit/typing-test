    "ec": "12.15 यस्मात् for whom? न not? उद्विजते is agitated? लोकः the world? लोकात् from the world? न not? उद्विजते is agitated? च and? यः who? हर्षामर्षभयोद्वेगैः by (from) joy? wrath? fear and anxiety? मुक्तः freed? यः who? सः he? च and? मे to Me? प्रियः dear.Commentary Harsha Joy? exhilaration of the mind when one obtains an object of desire. This is indicated by hair standing on end? tears flowing down the face? etc.Amarsha Anger. Some say that it is a mixture of jealousy and anger.Udvega Anxiety? worry? sorrow? discomfiture.The knower of Brahman or the devotee of the Lord never injures any creature in thought? word and deed. He gives security of life to all creatures. Therefore? no creature is afraid of him. The sage feels that the world is his body? his own Self. How can he be afraid of the world then He never hurts others and is not hurt by the words or deeds of others.The mental modifications of joy? envy? fear and anxiety leave the sage or devotee of their own accord? just as the beasts and birds leave the forest when it is on fire.Such a sage or devotee is dear to Me. How can I describe him"
