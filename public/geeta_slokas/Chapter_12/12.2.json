They have no other thoughts except those,of Myself. They live for Me only. Therefore it is indeed proper to say that they are the best Yogins.Are not the others? those who contemplate the imperishable? formless? attributeless? alityless Supreme Brahman? the best of Yogins Listen now to what I have to say regarding them."
