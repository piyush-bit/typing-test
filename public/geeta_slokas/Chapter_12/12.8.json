Give up entirely all thoughts of sensual objects. Fix in Me thy intellect also -- the faculty which resolves and determines.What will be the result then Thou shalt undoubtedly live in Me as Myself. O Arjuna? of this there is no doubt whatsoever.The Yoga of meditation is described in this verse. (Cf.VIII.7X.9XI.34XVIII.65)"
