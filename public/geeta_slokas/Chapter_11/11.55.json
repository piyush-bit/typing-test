    "ec": "11.55 मत्कर्मकृत् does actions for Me? मत्परमः looks on Me as the Supreme? मद्भक्तः is devoted to Me? सङ्गवर्जितः is freed from attachment? निर्वैरः without enmity? सर्वभूतेषु towards all creatures? यः who? सः he? माम् to Me? एति goes? पाण्डव O Arjuna.Commentary This is the essence of the whole teaching of the Gita. He who practises this teaching will attain Supreme Bliss and Immortality. This verse contains the summary of the entire philosophy of the Gita.He who performs actions (duties) for the sake of the Lord? who consecrates all his actions to Him? who serves the Lord with his heart and soul? who regards the Lord as his supreme goal? who lives for Him alone? who works for Him alone? who sees the Lord in everything? who sees the whole world as the Cosmic Form of the Lord and therefore cherishes no feeling of hatred or enmity towards any creature even when great injury has been done by others to him? who has no attachment or love to wealth? children? wife? friends and relatives? and who seeks nothing else but the Lord? realises Him and enters into His Being. He becomes one with Him.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the eleventh discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Vision of the Cosmic Form.,"
