    "et": "11.47 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, this Cosmic Form has graciously been shown to thee by Me by My own Yogic power; full of splendour, primeval, and infinite, this Cosmic Form of Mine has never been seen before by anyone other than thyself.",
    "ec": "11.47 मया by Me? प्रसन्नेन gracious? तव to thee? अर्जुन O Arjuna? इदम् this? रूपम् form? परम् supreme? दर्शितम् has been shown? आत्मयोगात् by My own Yogic power? तेजोमयम् full of splendour? विश्वम् universal? अनन्तम् endless? आद्यम् primeval? यत् which? मे of Me? त्वत् from thee? अन्येन by another? न not? दृष्टपूर्वम् seen before.Commentary Lord Krishna eulogises the Cosmic Form because Arjuna should be regarded to have achieved all his ends by seeing this Cosmic Form.It is also an inducement to all spiritual aspirants to strive to attain this sublime vision. What they should do is explained by the Lord in verse 53 to 55."
