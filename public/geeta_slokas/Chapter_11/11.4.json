    "ec": "11.4 मन्यसे Thou thinkest? यदि if? तत् that? शक्यम् possible? मया by me? द्रष्टुम् to see? इति thus? प्रभो O Lord? योगेश्वर O Lord of Yogins? ततः then? मे me? त्वम् Thou? दर्शय show? आत्मानम् (Thy) Self? अव्ययम् imperishable.Commentary Arjuna is very keen and eager to see the Cosmic Form of the Lord. He prays to Him to grant him the vision. This supreme vision can be obtained only through His grace.Yogesvara also means the Lord of Yoga. A Yogi is one who is endowed with the eight psychic powers (Siddhis). The Lord of the Yogins is Yogesvara. And? Yoga is identity of the individual soul with the Absolute. He who is able to bestow this realisation of identity on the deserving spiritual aspirant is Yogesvara.He Who is able to create? preserve? destroy? veil and graciously release is the Lord. (These five actions? Panchakriyas? are known respectively as Srishti? Sthiti? Samhara? Tirodhana and Anugraha.)"
