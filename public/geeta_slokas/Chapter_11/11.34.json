O Arjuna? you need not be afraid of incurring sin by killing them.Drona had celestial weapons. He was Arjunas teacher in the science of archery. He was Arjunas beloved and greatest Guru. Bhishma also possessed celetial weapons. He could die only if and when he wanted to die. He once faught singlehanded with Lord Parasurama and was not defeated. So powerful was he.The father of Jayadratha performed penance with a resolve the head of the man who may cause the head of my son to fall on the ground? shall also fall. During the war? however? Arjunas arrow cuts the head and drops it on the lap of the father who? inadvertently? makes it fall on the ground he too dies at once. Karna? the son of the Sungod? had obtained an unerring missile from Indra."
