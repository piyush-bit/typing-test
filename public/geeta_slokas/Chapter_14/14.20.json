    "ec": "14.20 गुणान् Gunas? एतान् these? अतीत्य having crossed? त्रीन् three? देही the embodied? देहसमुद्भवान् out of which the body is evolved? जन्ममृत्युजरादुःखैः from birth? death? decay and pain? विमुक्तः freed? अमृतम् immortality? अश्नुते attains to.Commentary Just as a river is absorbed in the ocean? so also he who has? while still alive? gone beyond the alities which form the seed from which all bodies have sprung and of which they are composed? is absorbed in Me. He ever enjoys the bliss of the Eternal. He attains release or Moksha. He attains to My Being.When the Lord said that the wise man crosses beyond the three alities and attains immortality? Arjuna became inspired with the desire of learning more about it. Just as he has asked a estion about the sage of steady wisdom in chapter II? verse 54? he now asks Lord Krishna about the characteristics of a sage who has crossed over the three alities. How does he act What is his conduct or behaviour How has he gone beyond the alities"
