    "ec": "3.25 सक्ताः attached? कर्मणि to action? अविद्वांसः the ignorant? यथा as? कुर्वन्ति act? भारत O Bharata? कुर्यात् should act? विद्वान् the wise? तथा so? असक्तः unattached? चिकीर्षुः wishing? लोकसंग्रहम् the welfare of the world.Commentary The ignorant man works in expectation of fruits. He says? I will do such and such work and will get such and such fruit. But the wise man who knows the Self? serves not for his own end. He should so act that the world? following his example? would attain peace? harmony? purity of heart? divine light and knowledge. A wise man is one who knows the Self. (Cf.II.64III.19XVIII.49)."
