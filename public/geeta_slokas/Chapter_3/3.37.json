    "et": "3.37 The Blessed Lord said  It is desire, it is anger both of the ality of Rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as the foe here (in this world).",
    "ec": "3.37 कामः desire? एषः this? क्रोधः anger? एषः this? रजोगुणसमुद्भवः born of the Rajoguna? महाशनः alldevouring? महापाप्मा allsinful? विद्धि know? एनम् this? इह here? वैरिणम् the foe.Commentary Bhagavan Bhaga means the six attributes? viz.? Jnana (knowledge)? Vairagya (dispassion)? Kirti (fame)? Aishvarya (divine manifestations and excellences)? Sri (wealth)? and Bala (might). He who possesses these six attributes and who has a perfect knowledge of the origin and the end of the universe is Bhagavan or the Lord.The cause of all sin and wrong action in this world is desire. Anger is desire itself. When a desire is not gratified? the man becomes angry against those who stand as obstacles on the path of fulfilment.The desire is born of the ality of Rajas. When desire arises? it generates Rajas and urges the man to work in order to possess the object. Therefore? know that this desire is mans foe on this earth. (Cf.XVI.21)."
