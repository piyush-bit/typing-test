    "ec": "3.7 यः whose? तु but? इन्द्रियाणि the senses? मनसा by the mind? नियम्य controlling? आरभते commences? अर्जुन O Arjuna? कर्मेन्द्रियैः by the organs of action? कर्मयोगम् Karma Yoga? असक्तः unattached? सः he? विशिष्यते excels.Commentary If anyone performs actions with his organs of action (viz.? hands? feet? organ of speech? etc.) controlling the organs of knowledge by the mind? and without expectation of the fruits of the actions and without egoism? he is certainly more worthy than the other who is a hypocrite or a man of false conduct. (Cf.II.64?68IV.21).The five organs of knowledge are the eyes? the ears? the nose? the skin and the sense of taste (tongue)."
