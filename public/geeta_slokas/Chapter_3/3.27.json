Sattva? Rajas and Tamas exist in a state of eilibrium. When this eilibrium is disturbed? creation begins body? senses? mind? etc.? are formed. The man who is deluded by egoism identifies the Self with the body? mind? the life force and the senses and ascribes to the Self all the attributes of the body and the senses. He? therefore? thinks through ignorance? I am the doer. In reality the Gunas of Nature perform all actions. (Cf.III.29V.9IX.9?10XIII.21?24?30?32XVIII.13?14)."
