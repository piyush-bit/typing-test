    "ec": "3.16 एवम् thus? प्रवर्तितम् set revolving? चक्रम् wheel? न not? अनुवर्तयति follows? इह here? यः who? अघायुः living in sin? इन्द्रियारामः rejoicing in the senses? मोघम् in vain? पार्थ O Partha? सः he? जीवति lives.Commentary This is the wheel of action set in motion by the Creator on the basis of the Veda and sacrifice.He who does not follow the wheel by studying the Vedas and performing the sacrifices prescribed therein but who indulges only in sensual pleasures lives in vain. He is wasting his life. He is leading a worthless life indeed.One who does not live in accordance with this law and who is selfish commits sin. He violates the law of the Creator and that is the worst sin."
