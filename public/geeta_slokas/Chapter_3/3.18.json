    "et": "3.18 For him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object.",
    "ec": "3.18 न not? एव even? तस्य of hi? कृतेन by action? अर्थः concern? न not? अकृतेन by actions not done? इह here? कश्चन् any? न not? च and? अस्य of this man? सर्वभूतेषु in all beings? कश्चित् any? अर्थव्यपाश्रयः depending for any object.Commentary The sage who is thus rejoicing in the Self does not gain anything by doing any action. For him really no purpose is served by an action. No evil (Pratyavaya Dosha) can touch him from inaction. He does not lose anything from inaction. He need not depend upon anybody to gain a particular object. He need not exert himself to get the favour of anybody."
