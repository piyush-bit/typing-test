    "et": "3.3 The Blessed Lord said  In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one; the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogins.",
    "ec": "3.3 लोके in world? अस्मिन् in this? द्विविधा twofold? निष्ठा path? पुरा previously? प्रोक्ता said? मया by Me? अनघ O sinless one? ज्ञानयोगेन by the path of knowledge? सांख्यानाम् of the Sankhyas? कर्मयोगेन by the path of action? योगिनाम् of the Yogins.Commentary The path of knowledge of the Sankhyas (Jnana Yoga) was described by Lord Krishna in chapter II? verses 11 to 38 the path of action (Karma Yoga) from 40 to 53.Pura Prokta may also mean In the beginning of creation the twofold path was given by Me to this world.Those who are endowed with the four means and who have sharp? subtle intellect and bold understanding are fit for Jnana Yoga. Those who have a tendency or inclination for wok are fit for Karma Yoga. (The four means are discrimination? dispassion? sixfold virutes? and longing for liberation. The sixfold virtues are control of the mind? control of the senses? fortitude (endurance)? turning away from the objects of the world? faith and tranillity.)It is not possible for a man to practise the two Yogas simultaneously. Karma Yoga is a means to an end. It purifies the heart and prepares the aspirant for the reception of knowledge. The Karma Yogi should take up Jnana Yoga as soon as his heart is purified. Jnana Yoga takes the aspirant directly to the goal without any extraneous help. (Cf.V.5)."
