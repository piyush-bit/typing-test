    "ec": "7.22 सः he? तया with that? श्रद्धया with faith? युक्तः endowed? तस्य of it? आराधनम् worship? ईहते engages in? लभते obtains? च and? ततः from that? कामान् desires? मया by Me? एव surely? विहितान् ordained? हि verily? तान् those.Commentary The last two words Hi and Tan are taken as one word? Hitan meaning benefits. This is another interpretation. The devotee who worships the lesser gods attains the objects of his desire (minor psychic powers? etc.). Those objects are ordained by the Lord only as He alone knows exactly the relation between the actions and their results or rewards and as He is the Inner Ruler of all beings. Unwise or undiscriminating people only take recourse to the means of getting these finite rewards which can hardly give entire satisfaction. Pitiable indeed is their lot They have,no power of eniry (VicharaSakti) or right understanding. They get hold of pieces of glass instead of attaining the jewel of the Self? of incalculabe value."
