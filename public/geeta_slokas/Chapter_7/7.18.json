    "ec": "7.18 उदाराः noble? सर्वे all? एव surely? एते these? ज्ञानी the wise? तु but? आत्मा Self? एव very? मे My? मतम् opinion? आस्थितः is established? सः he? हि verily? युक्तात्मा steadfastminded? माम् Me? एव verily? अनुत्तमाम्,the supreme? गतिम् goal.Commentary Are not the other three kinds of devotees dear to the Lord They are. They are all noble souls. But the wise man is exceedingly dear because he has a steady mind he has fixed his mind on Brahman. He does not want any worldly object? but only the Supreme Being. He seeks Brahman alone as the supreme goal. He practises Ahamgraha Upasana (meditation on the Self as the all). He tries to realise that he is identical with the Supreme Self. Therefore I regard a wise man as My very Self. (Cf.II.49)"
