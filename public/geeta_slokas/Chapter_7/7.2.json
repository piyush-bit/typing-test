    "ec": "7.2 ज्ञानम् indirect knowledge of Sastras? ते to thee? अहम् I? सविज्ञानम् combined with realisation (direct knowledge of the Atman through experience)? इदम् this? वक्ष्यामि will declare? अशेषतः in full? यत् which? ज्ञात्वा having known? न not? इह here? भूयः more? अन्यत् anything else? ज्ञातव्यम् what ought to be known? अवशिष्यते remains.Commentary Jnanam is Paroksha Jnanam or indirect knowledge of Brahman obtained through the study of the Upanishads. Vijnanam is Visesha Jnanam? i.e.? Aparoksha Jnanam obtained through direct Selfrealisation (intuitional wisdom).In this verse the Lord praises knowledge in order to make Arjuna follow His instruction closely with rapt attention? faith and interest. The Lord says I shall teach thee in full. You will attain to omniscience or perfect knowledge of the Self? after knowing which nothing more remains to be known here. If anyone attains the knowledge of the Self? he will know everything. That is the reason why Saunaka? the great householder? approacehd Angirasa respectfully and asked What is that? O Lord? which being known all this becomes known (Cf.XIII.11)"
