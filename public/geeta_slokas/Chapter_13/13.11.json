    "ec": "13.11 मयि in Me? च and? अनन्ययोगेन by the Yoga of nonseparation? भक्तिः devotion? अव्यभिचारिणी unswerving? विविक्तदेशसेवित्वम् resort to solitary places? अरतिः distaste? जनसंसदि in the society of men.Commentary The man of wisdom is firmly convinced that there is nothing higher than Me and that I am the sole refuge. He has unflinching devotion to Me through Yoga without any thought,for other objects. His mind has merged or entered into Me. Just as a river? when it merges itself in the ocean becomes completely one with it? even so he? being united with Me? worships only Me. This is Ananya Yoga or Aprithak Samadhi (Yoga of nonseparation or the superconscious state in which the devotee feels that he is nondistinct from God). Such devotion is a means of attaining knowledge. Such a devotee will never give up his devotion and worship even when he is under great trials and adversities.Viviktadesasevitvam He lives on the banks of sacred rivers? in caves? in the mountains? on the shores of seas or lakes and in beautiful solitary gardens where there is no fear of serpents? tigers or thieves. In solitary places the mind is ite calm. There are no disturbing elements that can distract ones attention. You can have uninterrupted meditation on the Self and can enter into Samadhi ickly.Society of men Distaste for the society of worldlyminded people? not of the wise? pure and holy. Satsanga or association with the wise is a means to the attainment of the knowledge of the Self."
