Now your heart is taking delight in Me.The Lord wants to encourage Arjuna and cheer him up and so He Himself comes forward to give instructions to Arjuna even without his reest.Paramam Vachah supreme word. Paramam means supreme? revealing the unsurpassed truth (Niratisaya Vastu which is Brahman).O Arjuna You are immensely delighted with My speech? as if you are drinking the immortalising nectar."
