The devotee constantly thinks of the Lord. His very life is absorbed in Him. He has consecrated his whole life to the Lord. According to another interpretation? all his senses (which function because of the Prana)? such as the eye are absorbed in Him. He takes immense delight in talking about Him? about His supreme wisdom? power? might and other attributes. He has completely dedicated himself to the Lord.He feels intense satisfaction and is delighted as if he is in the company of his Beloved (God). The Purana says? The sum total of the sensual pleasures of this world and also all the great pleasures of the divine regions (heavens) are not worth a sixteenth part of that bliss which proceeds from the eradication of desires and cravings. (Cf.XII.8)"
