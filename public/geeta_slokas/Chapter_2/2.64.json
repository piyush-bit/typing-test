Therefore? the mind and the senses like certain objects and dislike certain other objects. But the disciplined man moves among senseobjects with the mind and the senses free from attraction and repulsion and mastered by the Self? attains to the peace of the Eternal. The senses and the mind obey his will? as the disciplined self has a very strong will. The disciplined self takes only those objects which are ite necessary for the maintenance of the body without any love or hatred. He never takes those objects which are forbidden by the scriptures.In this verse Lord Krishna gives the answer to Arjunas fourth estion? How does a sage of steady wisdom move about (Cf.III.7.19?25XVIII.9)."
