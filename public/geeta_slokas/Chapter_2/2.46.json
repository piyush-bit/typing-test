    "ec": "2.46 यावान् as much? अर्थः use? उदपाने in a reservoir? सर्वतः everywhere? संप्लुतोदके being flooded? तावान्,so much (use)? सर्वेषु in all? वेदेषु in the Vedas? ब्राह्मणस्य of the Brahmana? विजानतः of the knowing.Commentary Only for a sage who has realised the Self? the Vedas are of no use? because he is in possession of the infinite knowledge of the Self. This does not? however? mean that the Vedas are useless. They are useful for the neophytes or the aspirants who have just started on the spiritual path.All the transient pleasures derivable from the proper performance of all actions enjoined in the Vedas are comprehended in the infinite bliss of Selfknowledge."
