    "ec": "2.52 यदा when? ते thy? मोहकलिलम् mire of delusion? बुद्धिः intellect? व्यतितरिष्यति crosses beyond? तदा then? गन्तासि thou shalt attain? निर्वेदम् to indifference? श्रोतव्यस्य of what has to be heard? श्रुतस्य what has been heard? च and.Commentary The mire of delusion is the identification of the Self with the notself. The sense of discrimination between the Self and the notSelf is confounded by the mire of delusion and the mind runs towards the sensual objects and the body is takes as the pure Self. When you attain purity of mind? you will attain to indifference regarding things heard and yet to be heard. They will appear to you to be of no use. You will not care a bit for them. You will entertain disgust for them. (Cf.XVI.24)."
