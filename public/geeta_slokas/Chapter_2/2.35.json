    "ec": "2.35 भयात् from fear? रणात् from the battle? उपरतम् withdrawn? मंस्यन्ते will think? त्वाम् thee? महारथाः the great carwarriors? येषाम् of whom? च and? त्वम् thou? बहुमतः much thought of? भूत्वा having been? यास्यसि will receive? लाघवम् lightness.Commentary Duryodhana and others will certainly think that you have fled from the battle from fear of Karna and others? but not through compassion and reverence for elders and teachers. Duryodhana and others who have shown great esteem to you on account of your chivalry? bravery and other noble alities? will think very lightly of you and treat you with contempt."
