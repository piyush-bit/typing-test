Man takes a body to enjoy them. If anyone performs actions for the sake of God in fulfilment of His purpose without desire for the fruits? he is released from the bonds of birth and attains to the blissful state or the immortal abode.Sages who possess evenness of mind abandon the fruits of their actions and thus escape from good and bad actions.Buddhi referred to in the three verses 49? 50 and 51 may be the wisdom of the Sankhyas? i.e.? the knowledge of the Self or AtmaJnana which dawns when the mind is purified by Karma Yoga."
