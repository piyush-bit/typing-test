    "ec": "2.50 बुद्धियुक्तः endowed with wisdom? जहाति casts off? इह in this life? उभे both? सुकृतदुष्कृते good and evil deeds? तस्मात् therefore? योगाय to Yoga? युज्यस्व devote thyself? योगः Yoga? कर्मसु in actions? कौशलम् skill.Commentary Work performed with motive towards fruits only can bind a man. It will bring the fruits and the performer of the action will have to take birth again in this mortal world to enjoy them. If work is performed with evennes of mind (the Yoga of wisdom? i.e.? united to pure Buddhi? intelligence or reason) with the mind resting in the Lord? it will not bind him it will not bring any fruit it is no work at all. Actions which are of a binding nature lose that nature when performed with eanimity of mind? or poised reason. The Yogi of poised reason attributes all actions to the Divine Actor within (Isvara or God)."
