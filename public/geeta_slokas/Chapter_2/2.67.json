    "ec": "2.67 इन्द्रियाणाम् senses? हि for? चरताम् wandering? यत् which? मनः mind? अनुविधीयते follows? तत् that? अस्य his? हरति carries away? प्रज्ञाम् discrimination? वायुः the wind? नावम् boat? इव like? अम्भसि in the water.Commentary The mind which constantly dwells on the sensual objects and moves in company with the senses destroys altogether the discrimination of the man. Just as the wind carries away a boat from its course? so also the mind carries away the aspirant from his spiritual path and turns,him towards the objects of the senses."
