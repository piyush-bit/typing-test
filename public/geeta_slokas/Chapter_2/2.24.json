It is beyond the reach of speech and mind. It is very difficult to understand this subtle Self. So Lord Krishna explains the nature of the immortal Self in a variety of ways with various illustrations and examples? so that It can be grasped by the people.Sword cannot cut this Self. It is eternal. Because It is eternal? It is allpervading. Because It is allpervading? It is stable like a stature. Because It is stable? It is immovable. It is everlasting. Therefore? It is not produced out of any cause. It is not new. It is ancient."
