    "ec": "16.12 आशापाशशतैः by a hundred ties of hope? बद्धाः bound? कामक्रोधपरायणाः given over to lust and anger? ईहन्ते (they) strive (to attain)? कामभोगार्थम् for sensual enjoyment? अन्यायेन by unlawful means? अर्थसञ्चयान् hoards of wealth.Commentary They murder people and rob them of their wealth in order to have sensual enjoyments. They amass wealth for sensepleasure only? but not for doing righteous actions. They have no mercy. They are very cruel. They are held in bondage by a hundred ties of expectation. They harbour in their hearts a craving for all kinds of sensual objects. Various sorts of desires crop up in their mind. When their desires are not gratified they become furious. They acire wealth by unjust means. Hope or expectation binds a man to the wheel of Samsara.,Therefore hope is likened to a cord or a rope. There is no end to their cravings. Though they possess enormous wealth their cravings are not appeased. They multiply daily. These people become hopeless victims of greed."
