    "ec": "16.7 प्रवृत्तिम् action? च and? निवृत्तिम् inaction? च and? जनाः men? न not? विदुः know? आसुराः the demoniac? न not? शौचम् purity? न not? अपि also? च and? आचारः (right) conduct? न not? सत्यम् truth? तेषु in them? विद्यते is.Commentary The demoniacal do not understand the nature of action and inaction (right abstinence). The idea of a Self apart from the body? doing nothing (actionless) but imply watching the play of the Gunas is something incomprehensible to them. They have no consideration for the interest of others. They work for the sake of their bodies or sensual enjoyment. They are greedy? selfish and cruel. Therefore? they have neither good conduct nor good behaviour. They are untruthful? unjust and impure. They do not know what actions they should do in order to attain the goal of life or end of human existence? nor from what actions they should refrain to ward off,evil.Those who are endowed with demoniacal alities are sunk in the mire of ignorance. They are totally ignorant of what is prescribed or what is prohibited action. They have not the least idea of what purity or cleanliness is. Their actions are crooked. They know neither right Pravritti nor right Nivritti. They have no idea of virtue or vice or of scriptural injunctions or prohibitions. They will never speak loving words. They are hypocrites and liars."
