Conseently man is deluded. He thinks? I act. I enjoy. I have done such and such a meritourious act. I will get such and such a fruit. I will enjoy in heaven. I will get a birth in a rich family.Of anyone even of His devotees.Man is bound when he is identifies himself with Nature and its effects -- body? mind? Prana or the lifeforce? and senses. He attains freedom or Moksha when he identifies himself with the immortal? actionless Self that dwells within his heart.When I does not act how can God accept good or evil deeds (Cf.V.29)"
