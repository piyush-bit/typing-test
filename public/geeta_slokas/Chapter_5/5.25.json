    "et": "5.25 The sages (Rishis) obtain absolute freedom or Moksha  they whose sins have been destroyed, whose dualities (perception of dualities or experience of the pairs of opposites) are torn asunder, who are self-controlled, and intent on the welfare of all beings.",
    "ec": "5.25 लभन्ते obtain? ब्रह्मनिर्वाणम् absolute freedom? ऋषयः the Rishis? क्षीणकल्मषाः those whose sins are destroyed? छिन्नद्वैधाः whose dualities are torn asunder? यतात्मानः those who are selfcontrolled? सर्वभूतहिते in the welfare of all beings? रताः rejoicing.Commentary Sins are destroyed by the performance of Agnihotra (a daily obligatoyr ritual) and other Yajnas (vide notes on verse III. 13) without expectation of their fruits and by other selfless services. The duties vanish by constant meditation on the nondual Brahman. He never hurts others in thought? word and deed? and he is devoted to the welfare of all beings as he feels that all beings are but his own Self. (Cf.XII.4)"
