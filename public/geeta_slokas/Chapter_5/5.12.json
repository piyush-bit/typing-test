    "et": "5.12 The united one (the well poised or the harmonised) having abandoned the fruit of action attains to the eternal peace: the non-united only (the unsteady or the unbalanced) impelled by desire, attached to the fruit, is bound.",
    "ec": "5.12 युक्तः the united one (the well poised)? कर्मफलम् fruit of action? त्यक्त्वा having abandoned? शान्तिम् peace? आप्नोति attains? नैष्ठिकीम् final? अयुक्तः the nonunited one? कामकारेण impelled by desire? फले in the fruit (of action)? सक्तः attached? निबध्यते is bound.Commentary Santim naishthikim is interpreted as peace born of devotion of steadfastness. The harmonious man who does actions for the sake of the Lord without expectation of the fruit and who says? I do actions for my Lord only? not for my personal gain or profit? attains to the peace born of devotion? through the following four stages? viz.? purity of mind? the attainment of knowledge? renunciation of actions? and steadiness in wisdom. But the unbalanced or the unharmonised man who is led by desire and who is attached to the fruits of the actions and who says? I have done such and such an action I will get such and such a fruit? is firmly bound."
